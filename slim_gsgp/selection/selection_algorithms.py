def tournament_selection_min(pool_size):
    """
    Returns a function that performs tournament selection to select an individual with the lowest fitness from a
    population.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pool_size : int
        Number of individuals participating in the tournament.

    Returns
    -------
    Callable
        A function ('ts') that elects the individual with the lowest fitness from a randomly chosen pool.

        Parameters
        ----------
        pop : Population
            The population from which individuals are drawn.

        Returns
        -------
        Individual
            The individual with the lowest fitness in the pool.
    Notes
    -----
    The returned function performs tournament selection by receiving a population and returning the best of {pool_size}
    randomly selected individuals.
